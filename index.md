### Daniel Reisch

**Field biologist. GIS specialist. Stats buff. Down to earth.**



I specialize in surveying mammals, amphibians, and birds with extensive experience throughout the Northeast. With over 2 years in conservation biological research and experience in handling and trapping endangered/threatened species, I am proficient in variety of wildlife research techniques with a desire to learn all that I can. I also have a deep interest in studying animal behavior and spatial-temporal movements of wildlife and the connection with habitat characteristics.
